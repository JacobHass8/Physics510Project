1) Simulate Particles Moving
	Note: This can be done by just generating xy values (we don't have to do the whole generating images every time)
	- Want to end with a .csv of xy values, time and particle ID	
	a) Diffusing particles
	b) Shearing particles 
	c) Particles merging 
		- Think two particles merging to 1
	d) Particles coming into existence
		- Think one particle comes into focus at some later time

1*) Finding Center of Particles
	- Right now I implemented this by finding local maxima and then only taking the largest couple maxima
	- Then I took a 3x3 region about each maxima and used MLE
	- It works somewhat well, but when particles get too close it  gets really bad 
	- There may be a better way to do this based on the stuff we did in Homework 8

2) Link Particle Tracks
	Should do this with multiple different algorithms
	a) Mean Squared Displacement (I've already implemented this)
		- This should break for the merging particles and particles coming into existence example
	b) TrackPy Algorithm
		- This should work well on most of the cases (except maybe the shearing case) 
	c) "Robust single-particle tracking in live-cell time-lapse sequences" Algorithm
		- I think there's a MatLab script for this
		- Issue is going to be getting the right data into the algorithm
		- I think they also need particle intensity  
	d) "Tracking Particles with Large Displacements using Energy Minimization"
		- Again, I think there's a MatLab script for this
		- Same issue with finding out what data we need to input 

3) Analyze How Well Algorithms Worked 
	- May be as easy as saying percent correct for each algorithm in each senario
